## How to Run This Project

To run this project, follow these steps:

### Install Ruby and Jekyll

If you are using Windows, it is recommended to use Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) to install Ruby and Jekyll. Follow the [Jekyll installation documentation](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/ubuntu/) to install Ruby and Jekyll on your WSL or Ubuntu system.

### Install Mise-en-Place

Follow the [Mise-en-Place documentation](https://mise.jdx.dev/getting-started.html) to install Mise-en-Place.

### Clone the Repository

Clone the repository to your local machine:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/vianest-itec/vianest-itec.github.io.git
cd vianest-itec.github.io
```

### Use Ruby 3.1.3

To resolve an issue with the latest version of Ruby and some dependencies of this template, switch to Ruby version 3.1.3 by running the following command in the project directory:

```sh
mise use ruby@3.1.3
```

This decision is due to an error with the newest version of Ruby and some of this template's dependencies. For more details, see [this issue](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll/issues/9233). However, this site will work fine on GitHub Pages.

### Install Dependencies

Install the required dependencies using Bundler:

```sh
bundle install
```

### Serve the Site

Serve the site locally:

```sh
bundle exec jekyll serve
```

Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4000` to view the site.

## To use the Creative Theme template in your project

Creating a site with this particular Jekyll theme, is basically writing a markdown site.

- Start by adding your info in `_config.yml`.
- Don't forget to change `_data/footer.yml` to update the copyright.
- In `index.md` reorder or remove section as you prefer.
- You can also add other pages, like `links.md`.
- Edit `_data/menus.yml` to add links in the navigation bar.

# Development
If you want to use this template, or enhance it, you can use Docker.
Just run './build-in-docker.sh' and then point your browser to http://localhost:4000/.

Note: Developing for github pages is tricky. You should always rely on
[safe plugins](https://pages.github.com/versions/) because any other, that's not
in the list will simply not run.
