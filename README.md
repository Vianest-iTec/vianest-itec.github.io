# Creative Theme for Jekyll

A Jekyll implementation of the [Creative Theme](https://startbootstrap.com/theme/creative/) template by [Start Bootstrap](https://startbootstrap.com).

An attractive one-page Bootstrap theme perfect for creative portfolios and businesses.

Based on Creative Theme v7.0.7 and Bootstrap v5.2.3.

## To use the Creative Theme template in your project

Creating a site with this particular Jekyll theme is basically writing a markdown site.

- Start by adding your info in `_config.yml`.
- Don't forget to change `_data/footer.yml` to update the copyright.
- In `index.md`, reorder or remove sections as you prefer.
- You can also add other pages, like `links.md`.
- Edit `_data/menus.yml` to add links in the navigation bar.

## Development

If you want to use this template or enhance it, you can choose between using Docker or running it locally.

### Option 1: Using Docker

Just run `./build-in-docker.sh` and then point your browser to [http://localhost:4000/](http://localhost:4000/).

### Option 2: Running Locally

#### Requirements
   - [**Ruby**](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/ubuntu/) Version 3.1.3
   - [**Jekyll**](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/ubuntu/) Version 3.9.2
   - [**Mise-en-place**](https://mise.jdx.dev/getting-started.html#_1-install-mise-cli) Version 2024.11.0 linux-x64 (eae29db 2024-11-01)

Follow these steps to run the project locally:

1. **Install Ruby and Jekyll**
   - If you're on Windows, it's recommended to use Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL).
   - Refer to the [Jekyll installation documentation](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/ubuntu/) for detailed guidance.

2. **Set Up the Environment**
   - Clone the repository:
      ```sh
      git clone https://github.com/vianest-itec/vianest-itec.github.io.git
      cd vianest-itec.github.io
      ```
   - Use Ruby 3.1.3 to avoid compatibility issues with the latest Ruby version:
      ```sh
      mise use ruby@3.1.3
      ```
      *Note: This step resolves issues between the latest Ruby version and some template dependencies. For details, see [this issue](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll/issues/9233).*

3. **Install Dependencies**
   Run the following command to install the required dependencies:
   ```sh
   bundle install
   ```

4. **Serve the Site**
   Serve the site locally by running:
   ```sh
   bundle exec jekyll serve
   ```
   Open your browser and navigate to [http://localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000/) to view your site.

*Note: Developing for GitHub Pages is tricky. You should always rely on [safe plugins](https://pages.github.com/versions/) because any other that's not in the list will simply not run.*
